I'm Alexander, a military veteran interested in Cybersecurity. Specifically in Purple Team concepts and Malware development, but I have a lot to learn.
Currently I am pursuing the OSCP utilizing TCM Security and HTB Academy CPTS training material. In the future, I would like to understand exploits better than I currently do, and eventually be able to develop my own for ethical purposes.
